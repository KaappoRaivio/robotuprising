### Solution description

Our approach is a hardcoded solution with remote controlled intervention if neccessary. However through some tasks well use manual control, because we did not manage to make the hardcoded solution to work on a neccessary level. In order for the hardcoded path to work we need to reset the robot's orientation at fitting checkpoints.

We wanted to use A* pathfinding in place of hardcoding, but could not achieve a sufficient exactness level. However, the Javascript files for this approach can also be found in this repository.

### Task 1

Hardcoded path in the maze.

### Task 2

Hardcoded path through the iron forest. Path obtained using pathfinder open source library.

### Task 3

Remote control. We don't have a mechanism for grabbing, so we bring a substitute cube with us and drop it to order the gate.

### Task 4

Remote control.

### Task 5

Remote control.

### Task 6 

Remote control.
